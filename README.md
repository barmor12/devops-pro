Frontend Project - React Website
This project is a simple frontend application built using React. The primary goal of this project is to learn how to work in Sprints and manage Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline workflows. This project serves as the frontend for a separate Node.js (Express) backend.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your local development environment.

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/barmor12/devops-pro.git
Change to the project directory:
cd <frontend-project-name>
Install the dependencies:
npm install
Run the development server:
npm start
The React app should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000. To interact with the backend, ensure that the backend project is also set up and running.
